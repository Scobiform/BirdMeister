# BirdMeister Version 0.0.5
Little CLI Tool for Twitter to automate Deleting Tweets, Lists, User friend Ids and start Filtered Streams. Using Tweetinvi. Very Scatchy. Will Update soon.

It is a good start also for people that get harassed by groups of people. Just grab all friend Ids and block all Ids with your account.

# Install
1. Register an APP at Twitter Developers
2. Put your APIKey and Secret in the Seceret manager in Visual Studio

$ dotnet user-secrets set "APIKey" "12345"
$ dotnet user-secrets set "APISecret" "12345"
