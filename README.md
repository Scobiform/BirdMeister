# BirdMeister Version 0.0.5
Little CLI Tool for Twitter to automate Deleting Tweets, Lists, User friend Ids and start Filtered Streams. Using Tweetinvi. Very Scatchy. Will Update soon.

It is a good start also for people that get harassed by groups of people. Just grab all friend Ids and block all Ids with your account.

# Install
You need to fill in your Twitter App Credentials under AuthTwitter. I will simplify the process in the next update.
